Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders can severely impact quality of life, affecting digestion and nutrient absorption. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and unexplained weight loss. Common GI conditions range from acid reflux, gastritis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to more severe issues like Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis, and GI cancers. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications. Treatments depend on the condition and may include dietary changes, medications such as antacids or antibiotics, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery. For chronic or complex cases, a comprehensive evaluation by a gastroenterologist is essential. Diagnostic tools may include endoscopy, colonoscopy, imaging, and blood tests.
